# Reliability analysis for complex repairable systems - An Nonparametric Bayesian approach

The purpose is to study reliability of multiple repairable systems. Complex repairable systems arranged in series were considered. Furthermore, a hybrid MCMC sampler algorithm composed by Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Gibbs sampling was built.
