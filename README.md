# Reliability analysis for complex repairable systems - An Nonparametric Bayesian approach

Nonparametric Bayesian Approach. The purpose is to study reliability of Multiple repairable systems. Complex repairable systems arranged in series were considered.

Warning!: It is necessary run the code with rgig.cpp file on the same directory.
